My note and sample code for learning Rust.

## 2020-09-22

Reading these articles while learning Rust makes me reconsider the language:

- [My Least Favorite Rust Type](https://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/least-favorite-rust-type.html):
  a critique on Rustâ€™s `std::ops::Range`.
- [Why not Rust?](https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html)

Coming from Go, Rust feels too complicated. Its near metal performance and
safety is great for a lot of my work, but it would be hard to find other Rust
developers to maintain them.
